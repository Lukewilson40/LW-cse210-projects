/*
Store a scripture, including both the reference (for example "John 3:16") and the text of the scripture.

Accommodate scriptures with multiple verses, such as "Proverbs 3:5-6".

Clear the console screen and display the complete scripture, including the reference and the text.

Prompt the user to press the enter key or type quit.

If the user types quit, the program should end.

If the user presses the enter key (without typing quit), the program should hide a few random words in the scripture, clear the console screen, and display the scripture again.

The program should continue prompting the user and hiding more words until all words in the scripture are hidden.

When all words in the scripture are hidden, the program should end.

When selecting the random words to hide, for the core requirements, you can select any word at random, even if the word was already hidden. (As a stretch challenge, try to randomly select from only those words that are not already hidden.)
